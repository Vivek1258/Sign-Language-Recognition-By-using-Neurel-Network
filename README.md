# Sign-Language-Recognition-By-using-Neurel-Network-
To create a Neural Network model That can predict the Sign language Symbols (Hand)

Understanding sign language is one of the primary enablers in helping users of sign language communicate with the rest of the society
Sign Language consists of fingerspelling, which spells out words character by character, and word level association which involves hand gestures that convey the word meaning

libraries used :

1) TensorFlow is an open source library for numerical computation and large-scale machine learning. TensorFlow bundles together a slew of machine learning and deep learning (aka neural networking) models and algorithms and makes them useful by way of a common metaphor.

2) Keras is an open-source neural-network library written in Python. It is capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Microsoft Cognitive Toolkit, R, Theano, or PlaidML. Designed to enable fast experimentation with deep neural networks, it focuses on being user-friendly, modular, and extensible

3) In computer programming, pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series. It is free software released under the three-clause BSD license.

4) NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed. ... It also discusses the various array functions, types of indexing, etc.

5) Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+

6)TQDM is a progress bar library with good support for nested loops and Jupyter/IPython notebooks

Dataset  Used :

Any data set can be used just maintain the format :
train-->catagories("A" , "B" , ....)-->Image data  
test-->catagories("A" , "B" , ....)-->Image data
